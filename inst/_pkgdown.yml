  description: "Efficiently manage and process data from 'oTree' experiments.
    Import 'oTree' data and clean them by using 
    functions to deal with messy data, dropouts,
    and other problematic cases. Create IDs, calculate the time, transfer
    variables between app data frames, and delete sensitive information.
    You can also check your experimental data before running the
    experiment and automatically make a codebook for your oTree code."
